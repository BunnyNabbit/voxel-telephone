# Game

Voxel Telephone is a game based on the "telephone game" which players build a given prompt and describe builds.

Each game begins with a prompt which players repeatedly build and describe until the 16th turn. When a game's 16th turn has been complete, the final sequence of descriptions and builds can be seen in the view level.

There is no time limit for games, and a player may take their time building or describing. If a player leaves while building, their game will be reserved for 1 hour before it is released back to other players.
