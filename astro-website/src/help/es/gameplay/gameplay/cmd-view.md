# /view

Usage: `/view <mode>`

Enters the view level where you can see finished and ongoing games.

When issued without a mode (`/view`), each game will be represented by a column with pairs of turns in each grid. If a game has not been finished, only icons representing the state of a turn will be visualized. If a game has been finished then the entire game sequence with builds and descriptions are visible.

`/view user` shows you all of your own builds, even if the game it is associated with isn't completed.

Players with moderation permission may use `/view mod` to enter a variant of the level to see builds for all games, even if they aren't complete.

Aliases: `/museum`, `/gallery`
