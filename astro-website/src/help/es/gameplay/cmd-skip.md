# /skip

The `/skip` command has different behaviors depending on the level type a player is in.

## Build or describe turn

Skips the current turn. Turn assignment will avoid giving you that turn.

## Tutorial level

Skips the current tutorial level. Each tutorial level may handle skips differently from completing it.
