# Where are levels?
Voxel Telephone does not have a list of levels. Instead, all game modes are in the `/main` level hub as portals.

Walk into the portals located in the hub to enter its game mode.

Alternatively, use the following commands to enter a game mode.
- `/play`: Enter a random game.
- `/view`: Enter the view gallery.
- `/main`: Enter the hub.
