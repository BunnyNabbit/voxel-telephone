# /play
Enters a new game. Games are picked randomly. If a game cannot be found, the system will prompt for you to create a new game by initializing its prompt.

If you abruptly leave a building turn, your game will be reserved for a hour. During the reservation period, you may re-enter the game by using the command. After that time has passed, the game will be released to other players.
