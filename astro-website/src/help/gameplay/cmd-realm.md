# /realm

Enters the personal realm view. All created realms by the user will be displayed.

This view initially starts off with a "Create a realm" icon. Double clicking this icon by breaking/placing a block twice will create a new realm.

Each realm is a 256x256x256 volume. Standard building commands and `/vcr` modes are supported. Existing realms can be joined by double clicking.

Aliases: `/os`, `/myrealm`
