# /Replace

Replaces blocks in a cuboid with another block type.

If no arguments are added, the block to replace is inferred from your current hand. Positions will be asked first and the replacement block is asked last.

Layout: `block:findBlock position:position1 position:position2 block:replacementBlock`

Aliases: `/r`

## Examples

- `/replace 0` to replace air blocks.
