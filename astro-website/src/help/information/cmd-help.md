# /help
Usage: `/help <a command, topic or category>`

Lists help documentation and aliases (shortcuts) for a command, topic or category. If used without an argument provided, a list of command categories and topics is listed along with a few featured commands.

For example, `/help vcr` will bring up the help documentation for the `/vcr` command.

Throughout help documentation, you may notice `<angled brackets>` and `[square brackets]`. This annotation helps describe a command's argument and if that argument is optional or not. `<angled brackets>` describe an optional argument, while `[square brackets]` are required arguments.
